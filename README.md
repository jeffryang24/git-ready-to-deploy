# Stay Up-To-Date with Your Remote

[gitsync.sh](gitsync.sh) is a simple script to ensure that a local clone is in
sync with a remote.

That is, no local, non-committed changes, and no new commits on the remote.

This is useful in a manual deployment setting where you also want to ensure
that the deployed version is under version control.
